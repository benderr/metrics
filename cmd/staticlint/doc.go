Package staticlint is a tool for static analysis of Go programs.

staticlint examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs,
such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format
string. It uses heuristics that do not guarantee all reports are
genuine problems, but it can find errors not caught by the compilers.

Registered staticcheck, stylescheck and simple analyzers:

	S1000        Use plain channel send or receive instead of single-case select
	SA1000       Invalid regular expression
	SA1001       Invalid template
	SA1002       Invalid format in time.Parse
	SA1003       Unsupported argument to functions in encoding/binary
	SA1004       Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep
	SA1005       Invalid first argument to exec.Command
	SA1006       Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments
	SA1007       Invalid URL in net/url.Parse
	SA1008       Non-canonical key in http.Header map
	SA1010       (*regexp.Regexp).FindAll called with n == 0, which will always return zero results
	SA1011       Various methods in the 'strings' package expect valid UTF-8, but invalid input is provided
	SA1012       A nil context.Context is being passed to a function, consider using context.TODO instead
	SA1013       io.Seeker.Seek is being called with the whence constant as the first argument, but it should be the second
	SA1014       Non-pointer value passed to Unmarshal or Decode
	SA1015       Using time.Tick in a way that will leak. Consider using time.NewTicker, and only use time.Tick in tests, commands and endless functions
	SA1016       Trapping a signal that cannot be trapped
	SA1017       Channels used with os/signal.Notify should be buffered
	SA1018       strings.Replace called with n == 0, which does nothing
	SA1019       Using a deprecated function, variable, constant or field
	SA1020       Using an invalid host:port pair with a net.Listen-related function
	SA1021       Using bytes.Equal to compare two net.IP
	SA1023       Modifying the buffer in an io.Writer implementation
	SA1024       A string cutset contains duplicate characters
	SA1025       It is not possible to use (*time.Timer).Reset's return value correctly
	SA1026       Cannot marshal channels or functions
	SA1027       Atomic access to 64-bit variable must be 64-bit aligned
	SA1028       sort.Slice can only be used on slices
	SA1029       Inappropriate key in call to context.WithValue
	SA1030       Invalid argument in call to a strconv function
	SA2000       sync.WaitGroup.Add called inside the goroutine, leading to a race condition
	SA2001       Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?
	SA2002       Called testing.T.FailNow or SkipNow in a goroutine, which isn't allowed
	SA2003       Deferred Lock right after locking, likely meant to defer Unlock instead
	SA3000       TestMain doesn't call os.Exit, hiding test failures
	SA3001       Assigning to b.N in benchmarks distorts the results
	SA4000       Binary operator has identical expressions on both sides
	SA4001       &*x gets simplified to x, it does not copy x
	SA4003       Comparing unsigned values against negative values is pointless
	SA4004       The loop exits unconditionally after one iteration
	SA4005       Field assignment that will never be observed. Did you mean to use a pointer receiver?
	SA4006       A value assigned to a variable is never read before being overwritten. Forgotten error check or dead code?
	SA4008       The variable in the loop condition never changes, are you incrementing the wrong variable?
	SA4009       A function argument is overwritten before its first use
	SA4010       The result of append will never be observed anywhere
	SA4011       Break statement with no effect. Did you mean to break out of an outer loop?
	SA4012       Comparing a value against NaN even though no value is equal to NaN
	SA4013       Negating a boolean twice (!!b) is the same as writing b. This is either redundant, or a typo.
	SA4014       An if/else if chain has repeated conditions and no side-effects; if the condition didn't match the first time, it won't match the second time, either
	SA4015       Calling functions like math.Ceil on floats converted from integers doesn't do anything useful
	SA4016       Certain bitwise operations, such as x ^ 0, do not do anything useful
	SA4017       Discarding the return values of a function without side effects, making the call pointless
	SA4018       Self-assignment of variables
	SA4019       Multiple, identical build constraints in the same file
	SA4020       Unreachable case clause in a type switch
	SA4021       'x = append(y)' is equivalent to 'x = y'
	SA4022       Comparing the address of a variable against nil
	SA4023       Impossible comparison of interface value with untyped nil
	SA4024       Checking for impossible return value from a builtin function
	SA4025       Integer division of literals that results in zero
	SA4026       Go constants cannot express negative zero
	SA4027       (*net/url.URL).Query returns a copy, modifying it doesn't change the URL
	SA4028       x % 1 is always zero
	SA4029       Ineffective attempt at sorting slice
	SA4030       Ineffective attempt at generating random number
	SA4031       Checking never-nil value against nil
	SA5000       Assignment to nil map
	SA5001       Deferring Close before checking for a possible error
	SA5002       The empty for loop ('for {}') spins and can block the scheduler
	SA5003       Defers in infinite loops will never execute
	SA5004       'for { select { ...' with an empty default branch spins
	SA5005       The finalizer references the finalized object, preventing garbage collection
	SA5007       Infinite recursive call
	SA5008       Invalid struct tag
	SA5009       Invalid Printf call
	SA5010       Impossible type assertion
	SA5011       Possible nil pointer dereference
	SA5012       Passing odd-sized slice to function expecting even size
	SA6000       Using regexp.Match or related in a loop, should use regexp.Compile
	SA6001       Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices
	SA6002       Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory
	SA6003       Converting a string to a slice of runes before ranging over it
	SA6005       Inefficient string comparison with strings.ToLower or strings.ToUpper
	SA9001       Defers in range loops may not run when you expect them to
	SA9002       Using a non-octal os.FileMode that looks like it was meant to be in octal.
	SA9003       Empty body in an if or else branch
	SA9004       Only the first constant has an explicit type
	SA9005       Trying to marshal a struct with no public fields nor custom marshaling
	SA9006       Dubious bit shifting of a fixed size integer value
	SA9007       Deleting a directory that shouldn't be deleted
	SA9008       else branch of a type assertion is probably not reading the right value
	ST1017       Don't use Yoda conditions
